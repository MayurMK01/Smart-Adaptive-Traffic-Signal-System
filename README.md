# Smart-Adaptive-Traffic-Signal-System
Smart Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System is designed to address the drawbacks of fixed-time traffic control systems. Fixed-time traffic control systems are not able to consider real-time traffic conditions.
     
This project will enable adaptive control of traffic signals depending upon actual density. This will result in reduction of waiting times at traffic signals and will ultimately minimize traffic congestions. It will also result in saving of fuel and reduction in pollution levels.

The system obtains traffic data like the number of vehicles per lane from traffic cameras, simulations, or traffic APIs. The obtained data is processed to filter out any errors and prepare the data. The traffic density is calculated and classified based on the lane and congestion levels.

An algorithm based on priorities helps in identifying the lane with the most congestion and therefore assigns the green light accordingly. The duration of the light gets dynamically altered, giving greater time to the heavily congested lanes than the other lanes. This cycle goes on continuously.

It is designed with Python programming, incorporating machine learning algorithms for traffic analysis and forecasting. Performance analysis indicates that waiting time, traffic flow, and fuel efficiency have improved compared to conventional traffic signal control methods.
